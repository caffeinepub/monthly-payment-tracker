  "summary": "Diff adds Vite env typings and an example .env file, plus updates to frontend documentation/summaries and project_state.json. There is no clear evidence of changes that would ensure a successful end-to-end IC build+deploy or address deterministic causes of intermittent deploy failures (e.g., dfx config, canister build/deploy scripts, dependency pinning).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Re-run the full build and deployment of the existing Finance Tracker app (Draft Version 2) to production on the Internet Computer, ensuring the process completes successfully end-to-end (frontend build, canister build, and deploy), and produce a live/public app URL as the deployment result.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows only added frontend env typing/example env file and documentation/project state changes; it does not show any deploy execution output, canister deployment changes, or configuration/scripts that would demonstrate an end-to-end successful deploy and resulting public URL.",

      "requirement": "Identify and resolve deterministic, project-level causes of intermittent build/deploy failure so consecutive deployments can be executed reliably (two consecutive runs succeed without manual intervention).",
      "reason": "No concrete build/deploy stabilization changes are evidenced (e.g., lockfile/dependency pinning, dfx.json/canister settings, CI scripts, build pipeline fixes, backend compilation fixes). The changes shown are primarily env typing/example env and documentation/state tracking.",

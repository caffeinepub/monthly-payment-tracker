  "summary": "Diff adds a full authenticated frontend flow (Internet Identity login screen, app layout with logout, transactions UI with month picker, summary totals + chart, and an in-app monthly reminder banner) and a Motoko backend with transaction APIs. However, several backend data-model and persistence acceptance criteria are not evidenced (stable persistence, transaction id/createdAt), and monthly ordering is not clearly implemented. The diff also introduces unrequested access-control/admin-token and user profile features.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Persist per-user transactions in stable storage so data survives canister upgrades.",
      "reason": "The backend uses in-memory `Map.empty` for `userTransactionsMap` and `userProfiles`, but the diff excerpt does not show any `stable var`, `preupgrade/postupgrade`, or other stable-structure persistence implementation.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Each transaction includes: unique id, kind (income/expense), amount, date, note, createdAt timestamp.",
      "reason": "The `Transaction` type shown contains `transactionType`, `amount`, `date`, and `note` only; no unique `id` and no `createdAt` are evidenced. Also `kind` is represented as `transactionType` but the acceptance criteria explicitly calls out `kind` plus required metadata fields.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Transactions within a selected month are ordered by date (newest first).",
      "reason": "`getTransactionsForMonth` filters and then returns `toArray().reverse()`. There is a `compareByDate` helper, but no sort is evidenced; reversing insertion order does not guarantee newest-by-date ordering.",
